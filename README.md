## Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer, if not:

### For Mac make sure you have homebrew installed and then open terminal and type 
  `brew install python3`
  
  If you don't have Homebrew installed
  
  `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`
  
  
### For windows, download python installer from this link and go through the installer:
  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
  
### Make sure you have all the requirements installed by changing to this directory then running:
  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
